# Question
> Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an
integer representing a target sum. If any two numbers in the input array sum
up to the target sum, the function should return them in an array, in any
order. If no two numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return
an empty array.

Input:
```
array = [3, 5, -4, 8, 11, 1, -1, 6]
targetSum = 10
```

Output:
```
[-1, 11]
```
