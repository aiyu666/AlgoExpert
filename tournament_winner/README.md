# Question
> There's an algorithms tournament taking place in which teams of programmers
  compete against each other to solve algorithmic problems as fast as possible.
  Teams compete in a round robin, where each team faces off against all other
  teams. Only two teams compete against each other at a time, and for each
  competition, one team is designated the home team, while the other team is the
  away team. In each competition there's always one winner and one loser; there
  are no ties. A team receives 3 points if it wins and 0 points if it loses. The
  winner of the tournament is the team that receives the most amount of points.

Input:
```
competitions = [
  ["HTML", "C#"],
  ["C#", "Python"],
  ["Python", "HTML"],
]
result = [0, 0, 1]
```

Output:
```
